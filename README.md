Notes:

int size = 27; states that the value of variable size is 27
String name = "Fido"; states that the word associated with name is "Fido"Dog myDog = new Dog(name, size); is adding a new object myDog with name and size attributes
x = size -5; states that you subtract 5 from 27 and that number is assigned to x


Code Structure:

Source file contains a class which represents a piece of the program
Class as stated above represents the program which are always inside curly brackets
The method is a statement such as an action or verb or function.


Do something - Statements, declerations, assignments. 
	in x = 3
Do something again and again - Loops
	while (x > 12) {
	x = x -1;
}
for (int x = 0; x < 10; x = x +1) {
	system.out.print("x is now" + x);
}

do something under this condition - Branching: if/else tests

one = is a assignment operator 
two == is the equals operator 

For the beer song, there were no else statements after if, I added else and that fixed the problem of bottles being plural when there is only one bottle

A class is not an object, but its used to contruct them.
